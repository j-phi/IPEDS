        "IPEDS has great [\"Compare Institutions\"](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/Data.aspx) feature that allows for large-scale downloading of data on multiple institutions. The challenge is that all of the columns are automatically encoded as numeric values by default. \n",
        "\n",
        "As an example, a University might be classifiable into two categories: 'Two Year' and 'Four Year'. In the dataset, instead of listing those values, the value will be encoded as '1' and '2'. You have the option of downloading a separate spreadsheet of value labels that explains the encoding for every column, but with most columns being encoded and many columns having a high number of possible options, it's too cumbersome to quickly analyze without an analytics platform like SAS or SPSS. \n",
        "\n",
        "As such, this script will automate the process of decoding the data. It accepts the data file and the value labels file, and then automatically re-converts the numerical representations into their original form.\n",
